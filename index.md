# minecraft-modding-tutorials
Here I will occasionally write unusual Minecraft modding tutorials for Forge 1.12. There won't be anything here that covers the basic setting up of a modding enviroment or any tutorials on learning Kotlin, however, I will point to resources at a later date. I will not cover how to make items, but I will share what I learn about Minecraft's rendering and any thought pieces I have on general modding design. I hope you find something useful here, and if you have any suggestions about what's here or what I could add, please submit an issue!
